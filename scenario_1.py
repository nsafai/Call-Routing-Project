# Situation: 1 phone number and 1000 routes in a text file

# Step 0: Copy full phone number including '+', for example '+14105548067'.
# Step 1: Open routes file.
# Step 2: Search for phone number using CMD+F (or CTRL+F on windows). 
#         If there are no search results, hit backspace in search bar.
# Step 3: Continue repeating Step (2) until you get a match. 
#         In the unlikely event you get several matches, choose the cheapest.
# Step 4: You're done!
#         - If you found a match in Step (3), the cost is the number on the right side of the comma.
#         - Otherwise, we don't have a matching route.
